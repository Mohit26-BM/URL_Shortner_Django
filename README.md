# Django URL Shortener üîó

This is a **URL Shortener application** built using the Django web framework.  
It allows users to input long, unwieldy URLs and quickly transform them into short, easy-to-share links.  

The project integrates with the **Bitly API**, which is a popular and reliable service for link shortening.  
On top of shortening, the app also focuses on a clean and minimal interface with a user-friendly workflow.

This project is designed not only as a learning tool for Django beginners but also as a fully functional application that can be deployed for personal use or extended into a production-ready system.
